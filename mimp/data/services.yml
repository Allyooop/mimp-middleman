   selling-points: "<h4>Nuclear Medicine Imaging</h4> <p>Following administration of a radioactive tracer (known as a radiopharmaceutical), a specialised scanner called a gamma camera is used to form an image showing the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical within the body.  Gamma camera images show how different organs or systems within the body are functioning - a unique insight that can often reveal signs of disease at a very early stage.</p><h4>Positron Emission Imaging (PET) imaging</h4> <p>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a highly specialised form of nuclear medicine imaging that uses a state of the art scanner to produce detailed images of metabolic processes within the body.  Introduced only a few years ago, PET has rapidly become an integral part of the diagnosis and staging of many types of cancer.  The Northern General campus houses the only permanently sited PET scanner in the area.</p> <h4>Non-Imaging Tests</h4> <p>Non imaging tests assess function by using extremely sensitive detectors to measure the amount of radiopharmaceutical in samples taken from the body - usually blood samples. Among other things, non-imaging tests can be used to measure kidney function and investigate a range of blood disorders.</p> <h4>Radionuclide Therapy</h4> <p>As well as diagnosing disease, radiopharmaceuticals can also be used to treat certain illnesses by delivering a highly targeted dose of radiation directly to the affected area.  Nuclear medicine therapy can be used to treat thyroid disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain types of cancer.</p>"
